\section{Implementation, Integration, Test plan}
In this section three main topics will be discussed: implementation order of the
various components, integration testing plan, general testing plan.

The \emph{SafeStreets} system is divided in these main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Mobile App
    \item Authority Web App
    \item Web Server
    \item Application Server
    \item DBMS
    \item File Server
    \item External API: DMV and Municipality
\end{enumerate}

As for the External API services, File Server and Web Server, these are less
critical components of the system, so they can be developed after implementing
the core features of \emph{SafeStreets}. The User Mobile App and Authority Web
App are merely frontend components, thus they can be developed independently
from the backend, which requires a more careful approach.

Here is a table showing the various functionalities of the system and their
respective importance for the customer and difficulty of implementation. Note
that the \emph{Importance for the customer} isn't in any way related to the
importance for the system by a structural point of view. For example the Login
feature is very important for \emph{SafeStreets} since we truly need to register
our users, but from the point of view of the costumer, it's something that won't
really be noticed.
