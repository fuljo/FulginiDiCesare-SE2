\section{Component Interfaces}
\label{sec:component_interfaces}
In Figure \ref{fig:interface_diagram} the interfaces of the components
described in section~\ref{sec:component_view} are shown.
The interfaces for the DBMS the WebServer and the FileServer are not
represented, since they are commercially available components with standard
interfaces.
A detailed explanation of the use of the various methods provided by the
interfaces is not necessary since those exact names are used in the Sequence
Diagrams, furthermore the names are mostly self-explanatory.
