\section{Functionalities and features}
Here is a table showing the various functionalities of the system and their
respective importance for the customer and difficulty of implementation. Note
that the \emph{Importance for the customer} isn't in any way related to the
importance for the system by a structural point of view. For example the Login
feature is very important for \emph{SafeStreets} since we truly need to register
our users, but from the point of view of the costumer, it's something that won't
really be noticed.

The development will follow a bottom-up approach, in order to improve components
reliability and progressively integrate the single components into the system.
Here is a list that describes which components will take care of each feature.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sign-up and Login:} the main component for this feature is
        \emph{AuthenticationManager}, also the \emph{DBMS} will be needed in
        order to save the user's data.
    \item \textbf{Violation Report:} for this feature \emph{ViolationManager} 
        and \emph{ViolationCollector} are needed, as well as \emph{DBMS}.
    \item \textbf{Automatic metadata insertion:} this is a minor feature and it
        is taken care by the \emph{UserMobileApp}.
    \item \textbf{Automatic License Plate detection:} this feature will be
        handled by \emph{LicensePlateExtractor} and will also involve the
        \emph{DMVAPIWrapper}.
    \item \textbf{Visualize Statistics:} both users and authorities will have
        access to this feature, it needs \emph{StatisticsEngine} and
        \emph{StatisticsRepresentationManager}, the rendering of the data is
        performed by \emph{UserMobileApp}, or the \emph{AuthorityWebApp}. In any
        case, these components have a little work to do. In order to access
        stored data, also the \emph{DBMS} will be necessary.
    \item \textbf{Manage Violation Reports:} in order to make this feature work,
        the component which is needed is \emph{ViolationManager}, and of course
        the \emph{DBMS}.
    \item \textbf{Collection of accidents data:} for this feature the system
        will need the \emph{AccidentDataCollector} implemented. The data will be
        stored into the database, so also \emph{DBMS} is required.
    \item \textbf{Visualize and manage suggestions:} this is the core function
        of \emph{SmartSuggestions} sub-system. The component in charge of this
        feature is \emph{SuggestionsManager}, which fetches data from the
        \emph{DBMS}.
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning to generate suggestions:} this is probably
        the most difficult feature to implement. So we will need to take
        specific care, the component is \emph{SuggestionsEngine}, as well as the
        \emph{DBMS} to retrieve and store data.
