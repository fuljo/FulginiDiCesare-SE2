\section{Overview}
The \emph{SafeStreets} system is divided in these main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Mobile App
    \item Authority Web App
    \item Web Server
    \item Application Server
    \item DBMS
    \item File Server
    \item External API: DMV and Municipality
\end{enumerate}

As for the External API services, File Server and Web Server, these are less
critical components of the system, so they can be developed after implementing
the core features of \emph{SafeStreets}, or better, they can be found on the
market, as they are commonly used components. By the way, it is strongly
recommended opting for the \emph{BUY} choice. The User Mobile App and Authority
Web App are merely frontend components, thus they can be developed independently
from the backend, which requires a more careful approach.

A final note is dedicated to the front-end components: UserMobileApp and
AuthorityWebApp. It is strongly recommended that these components are developed
using cutting-edge frameworks like \emph{Flutter} or \emph{React Native}. These
frameworks natively provide commonly used components like UI, data management,
and so on. These components are of course high quality written and already
tested. Last but not least these frameworks allow the developer to write the
code once and then run it on almost every mobile OS (or browser, for what
concerns the web app).
