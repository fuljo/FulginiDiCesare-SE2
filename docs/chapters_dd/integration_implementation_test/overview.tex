\section{Overview}
The \emph{SafeStreets} system is divided in these main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Mobile App
    \item Authority Web App
    \item Web Server
    \item Application Server
    \item DBMS
    \item File Server
    \item External API: DMV and Municipality
\end{enumerate}

As for the External API services, File Server and Web Server, these are less
critical components of the system, so they can be developed after implementing
the core features of \emph{SafeStreets}. The User Mobile App and Authority Web
App are merely frontend components, thus they can be developed independently
from the backend, which requires a more careful approach.
