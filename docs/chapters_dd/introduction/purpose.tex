\section{Purpose}
\subsection{General purpose}
The general purpose of the SafeStreets project has already been shown in the
RASD document, here we only provide the definition of the goals as a quick
reference. This document's purpose is to show both general and specific details
of the design choices made for the future development of SafeStreets. We will
discuss the design from different points of view, starting from a more general
and high-level representation of the system in the Overview (see
section~\ref{sec:overview}). Then a more specific view is given with the
Component Diagram (see section~\ref{sec:component_view}). Other low level
choices will be discussed in the following sections. Then all the architectural
styles will be shown as well as the design patterns used. A final chapter will
be dedicated to the schedule of the development plan and the testing phase.
