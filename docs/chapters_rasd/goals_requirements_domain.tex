based on their location, time, type or responsible vehicle}

\DefineRule{G6}{The user must be able to visualize anonymized violation
statistics only based on their location, time and type}

\DefineRule{G7}{The system must be able to retrieve data about accidents
from the municipalities that offer it (through an API)}

\DefineRule{G8}{The system must be able to determine unsafe areas by

to help preventing accidents}
