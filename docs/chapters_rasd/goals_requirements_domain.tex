% Here we define the macros for the goals, requirements and domain
% assumptions that will be printed elsewhere

%------------------------------------------------
%	Goals
%------------------------------------------------
\DefineRule{G1}{The system must allow users to notify authorities of parking
violations, by uploading pictures of the violation together with metadata
(date, time, position, infraction type, licence plate of the vehicle)}

\DefineRule{G2}{The system must be able to extract the licence plate number
from the photos uploaded by the users}

\DefineRule{G3}{The system must persistently store the violations
uploaded by the users, while keeping the uploader anonymous}

\DefineRule{G4}{The authorithy must be able to visualize, accept and refuse
the single violation reports that occurred in its competence area}

\DefineRule{G5}{The authorithy must be able to visualize violation statistics
based on their location, time, type or responsible vehicle}

\DefineRule{G6}{The user must be able to visualize anonymized violation
statistics only based on their location, time and type}

\DefineRule{G7}{The system must be able to determine unsafe areas by
matching data about violations and data about accidents.
It must then use such data to suggest actions that the authorithy can take
to help preventing accidents}

%------------------------------------------------
%	Domain assumptions
%------------------------------------------------
\DefineRule{D1}{A citizen can be uniquely identified by his fiscal code}

\DefineRule{D2}{The users' devices provide date and time with a precision of
1 minute or less, with resepect to UTC}

\DefineRule{D3}{The users' devices provide GPS location with a precison of
10 meters or less}

\DefineRule{D4}{Any vehicle that may commit a violation can be uniquely
identified by its licence plate number}

\DefineRule{D5}{Each location where the service can be used is associated
to exactly one municipality}

\DefineRule{D6}{Each municipality has exactly one authorithy that enforces
traffic rules in its territory}

\DefineRule{D7}{Authorities have demonstrated that the municipalities for
which they requested the violations are under their jurisdiction}

\DefineRule{D8}{The internet connection works without problems}

\DefineRule{D9}{The system can access the database of registered licence plates}

\DefineRule{D10}{The data about an accidents contains its location, timestamp
and type (within a finite list of types)}

%------------------------------------------------
%	Requirements
%------------------------------------------------

\DefineRule{R1}{The system must allow citizens to register by providing
fiscal code, username and password}

\DefineRule{R2}{The system must not allow two people (user or operator) to have
the same username. Also it must not allow two users (i.e.\ citizens) to have
the same fiscal code}

\DefineRule{R3}{The users must be able to upload photos from their mobile
devices}

\DefineRule{R4}{The system must be able to detect the date, time and location
of the users' devices}

\DefineRule{R5}{The system must allow the user to select the type of violation
he wants to report from a finite list of types}

\DefineRule{R6}{The system must allow the user to send violation reports}

\DefineRule{R7}{The system must allow the user to edit each field of the report
before sending it}

\DefineRule{R8}{The system must be able to determine whether a plate number is
valid (i.e.\ registered to the DMV) or not}

\DefineRule{R9}{The system must be able to detect the biggest licence plate in
a photo and read its number}

\DefineRule{R10}{The system must be able to persistently store the violation
reports, including their attached photos}

\DefineRule{R11}{Violations with malformed data (invalid date/time, inexistent
licence plate number, missing fields) or with no responsible authority must not
be stored by the system}

\DefineRule{R12}{When storing a violation report, the system mustn't save
the user who uploaded it. In particular it must not store any identifier
(e.g.\ fiscal code, username) that can provide such association}

\DefineRule{R13}{The system must allow the operators of authorities to login
with username and password}

\DefineRule{R14}{The system must be able to determine the municipality in which
a violation occurred based on the location saved in the report. It must be able
to assign the violation to the authorithy responsible for that municipality,
if any}

\DefineRule{R15}{An operator must be able to access only the violation reports
assigned to its authorithy. When a new report has been stored, he must be able
to mark it as accepted or discarded}

\DefineRule{R16}{Discarded reports are eventually deleted from the system}

\DefineRule{R17}{The system must be able to filter and aggregate violation
reports by location, date, time, type and licence plate number}

\DefineRule{R18}{The system must be able to compute statistics based on the
number of violations}

\DefineRule{R19}{The system must allow an authority operator to view statistics,
including filtering for the licence plate of the vehicles}

\DefineRule{R20}{The system must allow an user to view statistics which do not
include the licence plate of the vehicles involved}

\DefineRule{R21}{The system must be able to retrieve data about accidents
from municipalities that provide it (through an API)}

\DefineRule{R22}{The system must be able to determine if there is a causal
relation between accidents and violations based on their location, types and
timestamps}

\DefineRule{R23}{The system must be able to determine possible actions that
can be taken by the authorithy to reduce the detected accidents, also using
the detected causal relations}

\DefineRule{R24}{An authorithy operator must be able to view the suggested
actions for the zone in which the authorithy operates. He must also be able to
mark an action as \emph{carried out}, meaning that it has actually been executed}

\DefineRule{R25}{The system must be able to detect if a
\emph{carried out action} has been useful or not (i.e.\ the number of accidents
and/or violations that it was supposed to prevent has dropped or not) and
possibly provide better suggestions based on this knowledge}
