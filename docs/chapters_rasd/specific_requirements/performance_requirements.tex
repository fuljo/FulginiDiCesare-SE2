\section{Performance Requirements}
The aim is to build a unique system that is able to serve an entire state.
Since authorities can opt-in and out of the service, it is required for the
system to be \emph{scalable} from tens of thousands of citizens to few millions
and up to thousands of authorities. In particular the system must be able to
react to a large number of simultaneous requests from both citizens and
authorities.

The response time for simple operations like reporting and reviewing violations
should be less than 7 seconds; for more complex operations, like computing
statistics over large data sets, the response time can also be longer (in the
order of tens of seconds).
However, since this is not a critical system, greater response times can also
be tolerated, but only sporadically.

Regarding the \emph{SmartSuggestions} feature, we cannot set a precise boundary
on the time necessary to provide a suggested action, also because the involved
computations might be very heavy. The aim is that the newly inserted data
is processed within a week, but the exact time is left unspecified so
processing can be efficiently scheduled, for example, when the overall load
of the system is low.
