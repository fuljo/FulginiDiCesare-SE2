\subsubsection{Scenarios}

\paragraph{Scenario 2}
Milan's Local PD cannot afford to send every morning several traffic cops to
prevent people from parking on the crosswalks, there are more urgent works to
do! But at the same time this type of infraction cannot be backed off. To fix
this problem, the Local PD can use \emph{Safe Streets}. A Local PD operator can
see from his screen all the reports regarding that specific type of violation
and then take action against them.
