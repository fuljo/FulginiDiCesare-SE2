% TODO: Specify scenarios

\paragraph{Scenario 1}
Davide is a Professor Assistant at his University and lives five minutes away
from his office. He is a very healthy person, everyday he goes to his office by
bike, and most of the days he finds a car parked on the bicycle lot, so he has
to leave his bike in an unsafe place, where it can be stole. Davide is
sick of this situation and wants to to something about it. He knows that the
Municipality of Milan recently deployed a new service: \emph{Safe Streets}, that
can be used to report situations like this. He downloads the App, registers,
logs in and then takes a picture of the car illegally parked on the bike lot.
The morning after Davide goes to his office as always by bike and to his
surprise the bike lot was free, so the new \emph{Safe Streets} works for real!

\paragraph{Scenario 2}
Milan's Local PD cannot afford to send every morning several traffic cops to
prevent people from parking on the crosswalks, there are more urgent works to
do! But at the same time this type of infraction cannot be backed off. To fix
this problem, the Local PD can use \emph{Safe Streets}. A Local PD operator can
see from his screen all the reports regarding that specific type of violation
and then take action against them.
