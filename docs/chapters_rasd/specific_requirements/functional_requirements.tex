\section{Functional requirements}
In this section we start by analyzing the \emph{scenarios} and defining
the \emph{use cases} (and related sequence diagrams) for each user class
(citizens and authorities).
Then we programmatically show the requirements that the S2B must satisfy in
order to reach the goals.

\subsection{User}

\subsubsection{Use cases}
In figure \vref{fig:uc_diagram_user} the various use cases in which the user
participates are shown.
After that we describe each use case in further detail and provide a sequence
diagram which shows the various steps.
