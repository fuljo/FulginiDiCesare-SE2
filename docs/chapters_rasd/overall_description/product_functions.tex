\section{Product functions}
In this section the major functions of the S2B will be summarized.

\subsection{Report a Violation}
This is the core function of the system. When a user spots a violation, it can open the app, log-in using username and password and rapidly take a picture.
The system will now run an OCR algorithm to find the biggest licence plate on the picture and extract the number. Other information are required to complete the violation report: date, time and position. They can be collected through the standard tools of the mobile host device. If one or more of these information are wrong or incomplete, then the user can correct the wrong ones. Finally the user must select the right Violation Type. When a Violation report has been completed, the user can choose wheter to confirm it so that it will be sent.
