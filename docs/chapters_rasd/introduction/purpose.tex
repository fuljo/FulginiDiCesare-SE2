\section{Purpose}
\subsection{General purpose}
The core idea behind SafeStreets is that in order to enforce the traffic laws,
the help of everyone is necessary, including common citizens.
SafeStreets is a system that allows citizens to report infractions to the
authorities, while staying anonymous.

The user experience will be as smooth as possible, a person that spots a
traffic law violation, can open the app, take a picture and with a few
\emph{taps} send it to the authorities of its municipality.
The system will try to automatically collect all the data required to complete
a violation report: location, date, time and licence plate number. In case
something doesn't work, the user will be asked to fill in the incomplete data.
When sending the violation report, there is no need to address a specific
authority, the system will route the report to the correct one automatically.

From the side of the authorities, the system will show all the violation reports
occurred in the municipalities under that specific authority control.

Both citizens and operators can obtain some statistics from the system. These
statistics will show how the different violations are distributed in space, time,
and type. It's worth mentioning that citizens won't of course see the specific
vehicle statistics, for privacy reasons.

In case a municipality offers data about accidents, SafeStreets will use the
\emph{SmartSuggestions} technology to cross this data with the violation 
reports and automatically suggest the authority some \emph{actions} that can be
carried out to prevent the same accidents/violations from occurring again.

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{description}
    \RuleItem{G1}
    \RuleItem{G2}
    \RuleItem{G3}
    \RuleItem{G4}
    \RuleItem{G5}
    \RuleItem{G6}
    \RuleItem{G7}
    \RuleItem{G8}
\end{description}

\noindent
The word \emph{must} in the description of this goals refers to a mandatory
objective that the system will be able to accomplish, in the scope defined
by the domain assumptions.
However it is worth to point out that specifically for G2 and G8,
the ability to accomplish the objective may vary depending on the
quality of the input data.
