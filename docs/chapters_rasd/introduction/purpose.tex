\subsection{Goals}

\begin{description}
    \item[G1] The system must allow users to notify authorities of
    parking violations, by uploading pictures of the violation
    together with metadata
    (date, time, position, infraction type, licence plate of the vehicle)
    \item[G2] The system must be able to extract the license plate number
    from the photos uploaded by the users
    \item[G3] The system must persistently store the violations
    uploaded by the users, while keeping the uploader anonymous
    \item[G4] The authorithy must be able to visualize and possibly delete 
    the single violations stored by the system
    \item[G5] The authorithy must be able to assign a level of priority
    to each violation
    \item[G6] The authorithy must be able to visualize violation statistics
    based on their location, time, type or responsible vehicle
    \item[G7] The user must be able to visualize anonymized violation
    statistics only based on their location, time and type
    \item[G8] The system must be able to retrieve data about incidents
    from the municipalities that offer it (through an API)
    \item[G9] The system must be able to determine unsafe areas by
    matching data about violations and data about accidents, and also
    to suggest improvements to help preventing accidents      
\end{description}

\noindent
The word \emph{must} in the description of this goals refers to a mandatory
objective that the system will be able to accomplish, in the scope defined
by the domain assumptions.
However it is worth to point out that specifically for G2 and G9,
the ability to accomplish the objective may vary depending on the
quality of the input data.
