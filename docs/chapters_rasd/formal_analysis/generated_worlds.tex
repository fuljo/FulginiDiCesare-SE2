\section{Generated Worlds}
With the following command we can generate some examples of the model we 
formalized.

\begin{alloy}
    run show {
        #Operator > 1
        #User > 1
        #Location > 1
        #Violation > 1
    } for 4 but 9 Int
\end{alloy}
In particular we are asking the solver to have in our sample world at least 2
\emph{Operators}, 2 \emph{Users}, 2 \emph{Locations} and 2 \emph{Violations}.
Furthermore we are limiting the maximum cardinality for each entity at 4, and
the Integers in our model have a bitwidth of 9.
