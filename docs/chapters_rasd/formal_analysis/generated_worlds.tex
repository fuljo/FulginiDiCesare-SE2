\section{Generated Worlds}
With the following command we can generate some examples of the model we 
formalized.
\input{alloy/alloy_generated_worlds.tex}
In particular we are asking the solver to have in our sample world at least 2
\emph{Operators}, 2 \emph{Users}, 2 \emph{Locations} and 2 \emph{Violations}.
Furthermore we are limiting the maximum cardinality for each entity at 4, and
the Integers in our model have a bitwidth of 9.
