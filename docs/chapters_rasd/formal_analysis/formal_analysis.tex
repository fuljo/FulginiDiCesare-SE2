\chapter{Formal Analysis}
In this chapter we will formally analyze our representation of the world as
described in Figure \ref{fig:classDiagram} using the Alloy language. Firstly we
define all the entities that populate the world, then we specify a set of
constraints that keep the representation coherent. Lastly we define some
functions that allow to see some properties of the model.
