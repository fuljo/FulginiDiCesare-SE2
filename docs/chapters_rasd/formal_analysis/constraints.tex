\section{Constraints}
Here are defined all the constraints needed to keep the model coherent. The
majority of these are called \emph{noFoster[...]} and the name self describes
what the constraint does: we do no want usernames or passwords without their own
owner, same for pictures without their own violation, license plate without vehicle
and so on.

The second set of constraint defines the uniqueness of some entities, for
example there cannot be two different people with the same fiscal code or two
vehicles with the same license plate. These are constraints that are needed due
to real world limitations, but similar constraints are defined for entities not
present in the real world, for example \emph{Username}, which has to be unique
only due to our model design.
